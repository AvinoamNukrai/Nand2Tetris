# NandToTetris-Course
The Nand-to-Tetris course teaches how to build a computer from primitive Nand gates. The second part teaches how to build a fully fledged High level programming language running the Hack computer built in the first part. The all project of the course is to build a reall and valid computer (Hack computer) from scratch (Nand gate), this big project consist from 12 sub projects - the excercises of the course.

The hardware sub-projects(1-6):
can be built on any personal computer using a simple Hardware Description Language (HDL), described in the course materials,
and a supplied Hardware Simulator.

The softwaresub- projects(6-12):
(assembler, virtual machine, and compiler for a simple object-based language) can be developed in any programming language,
using the project materials available in this site. A basic OS is also built, using the high-level language designed in the course.
